1. My AI seems to output correct values for the beginning but then it begins to output odd values halfway
through. I have debugged my legal moeves iterator and AI find moves over and over again but cannot seem to
find out how my moves would just fall apart after halfway or so.
2. This error happens when I run main and call auto white.
